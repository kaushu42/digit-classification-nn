## digit-classification-nn
## Classification of digits using a neural network with a single hiddenlayer. 

Uses ReLU as the activation for the hidden layer and softmax to predict the digits.

The dataset used is from sklearn.datasets.load_digits

Created from scratch using only numpy and sklearn for some features.

This project is modified from on my other repo digit-classification (which used no hidden layers).
